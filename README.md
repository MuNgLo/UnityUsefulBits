# UnityUsefulBits

The idea here is for me personally to keep a collection of useful bits of code and more that is easy to drop in, use and build from in future projects. I just don't see why I shouldn't share it for anyone who has any interest or need of it. It might also get me lambasted for my bad code but that is fine. I never said I was good. ;)

# MenuSystemExample
Simple menu example revolving around one monobehaviour that handles its child objects by name. All you have to do is point a button to the GoToMenu(childname) method and you are set.
